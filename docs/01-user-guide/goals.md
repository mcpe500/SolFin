# Goal-based Savings

This section describes how to set and track your financial goals in SolFin.

## Creating a Goal (FR-7)

SolFin allows you to create specific financial goals and helps you track your progress towards them. To create a new goal:

1.  **Navigate to the Goals section:** Access this from the main dashboard or navigation menu.
2.  **Add New Goal:** Click on the "Add New Goal" button.
3.  **Provide Goal Details:**
    *   **Title:** A descriptive name for your goal (e.g., "Buy PS6").
    *   **Target Amount:** The total amount of money you need to save for this goal (e.g., $600).
    *   **Target Date:** The date by which you aim to achieve this goal (e.g., "2026-12-01").
    *   **Linked Pouch:** Associate the goal with an existing pouch. This pouch will be used to track contributions towards this specific goal.
4.  **Save Goal:** Confirm and save your new goal.

## Tracking Progress

Once a goal is created, SolFin automatically calculates the required monthly contribution needed to reach your target amount by the target date.

*   **Progress Bar:** A visual progress bar will show how close you are to achieving your goal.
*   **Alerts:** SolFin will provide alerts if you are falling behind your required monthly contribution, helping you stay on track.

## Goal Management (CRUD)

SolFin supports full CRUD operations for goals:

*   **Create:** As described above.
*   **Read:** View details and progress of any existing goal.
*   **Update:** Modify goal details such as target amount, target date, or linked pouch.
*   **Delete:** Remove a goal. (Note: Deleting a goal will not affect transactions already made to the linked pouch, but it will stop tracking progress for that specific goal.)
