2. Tap on "Add New Account".
3. Provide the following details:
    *   **Currency:** (e.g., USD, EUR, IDR)
    *   **Type:** (e.g., Cash, Savings, Credit, Loan, Crypto)
    *   **Initial Balance:** The starting amount in your account.
4. Save the account.

## Making Your First Transaction

Once you have an account, you can record your first transaction (FR-3).

## Understanding Pouches

Pouches (FR-2) are like budget buckets. You can categorize your spending and income into different pouches to manage your budget effectively.

## Transfers Between Accounts/Pouches

Use the Transfer feature (FR-4) to move money between your accounts or between pouches. This creates a linked pair of transactions for clear tracking.
